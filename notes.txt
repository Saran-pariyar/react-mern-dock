Docker workflow:

1. Docker Client -> UI for using docker (CLI, GUI) Example: Docker run/build, etc. commands (Chef giving instructions to staffs)

2. Docker Host (DAEMON) -> background process for managing containers. Listens to docker client's commands then creates & manages containers, build images, etc.

3. Docker registry (Docker Hub) -> GitHub of Docker images

Docker images are stored in registries, when we run containers, docker pull required images if it's unavailable locally.

Commands we used:

1. docker pull ubuntu

-it -> interactive

2. docker run -it ubuntu (with this, now we can use Ubuntu!!)

3. docker stop <container id or name>
